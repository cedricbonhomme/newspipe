Documentation

A documentation is available `here <https://newspipe.readthedocs.io>`_ and
provides different ways to
`install Newspipe <https://newspipe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment.html>`_.

Test Newspipe on Heroku:

    :target: https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/newspipe/newspipe.git

It is important to specify an application name and the URL of your instance
(*PLATFORM_URL*) through the Heroku form.


Contributions
-------------

Contributions are welcome. If you want to contribute to Newspipe I highly
recommend you to install it in a Python virtual environment. For example:


.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install postgresql npm

It seems that today a proof of good taste is to install first
`pyenv <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>`_,
then `pipsi <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi>`_, and finally
`pew <https://github.com/berdario/pew>`_ and
`pipenv <https://github.com/pypa/pipenv>`_ with pipsi.

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/newspipe/newspipe.git
    cd newspipe/
    pipenv install
    ✨🍰✨
    npm install
    cp src/conf/conf.cfg-sample src/conf/conf.cfg
    pipenv shell
    python src/manager.py db_create
    python src/runserver.py
