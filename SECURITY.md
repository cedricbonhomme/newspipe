# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Last stable version always provides security updates.
There will be no security patches for other releases (tagged or not).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the case of a security vulnerability report, we ask the reporter
to send it directly to cedric@cedricbonhomme.org, if
possible encrypted with the following GnuPG key:
**55F5 D60E EFCA 3591 0089 18E7 A1CB 94DE 57B7 A70D**.
We usually fix reported and confirmed security vulnerabilities
in less than 48 hours, followed by a software release containing
the fixes within the following days.
